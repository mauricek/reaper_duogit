# reaper_duogit
ReaScripts to create Actions (dis)arming guitar tracks.

Can be used in conjunction with a MIDI footswitch controller.

Tested:
  - Harley Benton MP-100

Probably works with all other MIDI controllers as well, like the currently hyped MeloAudio MIDI Commander, which is the very same build as the MP-100.

Feel free to change in whatever fashion you like.
